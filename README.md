# Credit-card-fraud-detection
The goal of this project is to find fraud in credit card data. The problem is that dataset is highly inbalanced.

Data comes from https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud ant this is database of real credit card use. It has 270k records and since it is so big I wasn't able to upload it on github.
Data is encrypted and practically preprocessed. It is however very unbalanced dataset, because it contains only 500 signal records and 270k noise, so the biggest task is to handle that imbalance.
The goal is to predict if certain use is a fraud one.
